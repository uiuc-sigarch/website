* Meetings
We host weekly meetings *wednesdays* from *4-5pm* in *ECEB 2013*. These meetings use a split format, with the first half devoted to the high level summary of a relevant topic, and the second half devoted to the discussion of a paper. We're always looking for people interested in running meetings, so if you have an idea, reach out!
For an archive of past meetings, see [[./meetings.org][here]].

* Workshops
New for *Fall 2023*, we will be hosting semi-regular weekend workshops directed at giving members hands on exposure to projects in computer architecture and chip design.
